### Sample API Route Files

* github-v3.0.0.json - Provides a map of routes and requirements for github v.3 API.

* twitter-v1.0.0.json - Provides a map of routes for the twitter v.1 API.

### How to Use
The files in this folder are designed to provide a starting point for either a limited implementation of 
an existing API provider, or a starting point for providing a simple implementation of your API. Using 
a npm dependency to this project and local API routes file any node.js can implement an API consumer.
